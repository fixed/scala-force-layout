The file [miserables.json](https://github.com/rsimon/scala-force-layout/blob/master/src/test/resources/examples/miserables.json)
contains the weighted network of coappearances of characters in Victor Hugo's novel "Les Miserables".
Nodes represent characters as indicated by the labels, and edges connect any pair of characters that
appear in the same chapter of the book. The values on the edges are the number of such coappearances.
The data on coappearances were taken from D. E. Knuth, The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for 
Combinatorial Computing, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993).

The group labels were transcribed from "Finding and evaluating community structure in networks" 
by M. E. J. Newman and M. Girvan.
