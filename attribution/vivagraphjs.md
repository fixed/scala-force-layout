I have based the parameters of my physics model (constants for spring forces, node repulsion, gravity, etc.) on
those used in the [VivaGraphJS](http://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS) JavaScript library by Andrei Kashcha.
While _Scala Force Layout_ does not include any code portions from this library, I still think it's appropriate 
to acknowlege Andrei Kashcha's work here.
