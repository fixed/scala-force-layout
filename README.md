# Scala Force Layout

_Scala Force Layout_ is a force-directed graph layout implementation for Scala, based on a basic spring 
physics model. To a wide extent, this code is a port of the [Springy](http://getspringy.com/) JavaScript 
library by Dennis Hotson. But I'm working on including ideas from other libraries as well.
